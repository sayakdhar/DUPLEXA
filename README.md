# DUPLEXA
The proposed application aims at converting sign language into human readable format (as subtitles) and projects it directly to our eyes/spectacles. This enables a person, whoâ€™s otherwise not acquainted with sign lexicons to understand a dumb person. As promised for duplex connectivity, the person who wishes to communicate with a mute person, can type in just the exact sentences which will be translated into the relevant signs and made available through the display The application can be scaled by making it capable of deciphering Braille as well, which can serve as a respite for normal persons understand the script as well
